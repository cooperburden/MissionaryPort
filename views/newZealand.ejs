           <h2>Hangi</h2>

           <h2>History of the Church in New Zealand</h2>
           <p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was introduced to New Zealand in 1854 by Samuel M. R. Snow. Initially, members of the Church were isolated, but as the number of converts grew, the Church began to establish a more visible presence. The first baptism in New Zealand took place in the Bay of Islands, and by the 1870s, a branch was organized in Auckland. Today, New Zealand is home to a vibrant LDS community with multiple stakes and a temple in Hamilton.</p>
           <p>In 1958, the New Zealand Mission was established, and in 1967, the first stake in New Zealand was organized in Auckland. The Church has continued to grow, and there are currently over 70,000 Latter-day Saints in the country. New Zealand has become a key area for missionary work, with missionaries actively engaged in spreading the gospel throughout the country.</p>
