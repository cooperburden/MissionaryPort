            <h2>Rolex</h2>
            <p>In Uganda, a "Rolex" isn’t a luxury watch but a beloved street food made by rolling an omelet with vegetables inside a chapati.

            <h2>Language</h2>
            <p>
                Uganda is a linguistically diverse country with over 40 distinct local languages spoken across its regions. Luganda, the language of the Baganda people, 
                is the most widely spoken and serves as a common means of communication in central Uganda, including the capital, Kampala. While Luganda holds cultural 
                significance and is used in media and education, other tribal languages such as Acholi, Runyankole, and Ateso are also prevalent in their respective regions. 
                This linguistic richness reflects Uganda's vibrant cultural diversity and deep tribal heritage. While Luganda is the most common spoken language in Uganda, the two
                official languages of the country are English and Swahili. </p>

            <h2>Currency</h2>
            <p>
                The official currency of Uganda is the Ugandan Shilling (UGX). It is used for all transactions within the country. Banknotes are available in denominations of 1k, 5k, 10k, 20k and 50k shillings, 
                while coins come in values of 50, 100, 200, and 500 shillings. The Ugandan Shilling's value fluctuates against major global currencies, but it remains the primary form of 
                currency for both everyday purchases and larger transactions. Currently, one US Dollar converts to about 3,700 shillings. </p>

        <h2>History of the Church in Uganda</h2>
        <p> The first Ugandan members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints were Edward Ojuka, Mary Jean Akello, and Charles Osinde, who joined the Church while living 
            abroad in 1987. A few years later, they returned to Uganada, where they woudl hold organized meetings in their homes. It wasnt until 1990 when the first local Ugandan convert
            was baptized in the country. 
        </p>
        <p> In 1991, the first branch of the LDS Church, the Kampala Branch, was organized. With more than 30 in attendance, the members started to officially meet every Sunday. 
            About 6 months later, members gathered at the Sheraton Hotel in Kampala for the dedication of Uganda for the preaching of the gospel by Elder James E. Faust of the 
            Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.

        <br><br>
        <p> In 1992, the Kampala Uganda district was organized, and a year later the Jinja Uganda district was established. It wasnt until 2010 when the first stake was organized.
             This stake was the Kampala Uganda Stake, with Jimmy Carter Okot as the stake president. Now Uganda currently has 3 stakes, 3 districts, and a temple was announced in the October 
             2024 General Conference. There are currently over 22,000 members with 18 wards and 21 branches.
